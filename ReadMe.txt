Weaknesses of the Distributed Solution
---------------------------------------------
Single Point of Failure: If the Redis server goes down, the whole system can be affected.
Latency: Network latency can affect the performance of checking and setting keys in Redis, especially in a high-traffic scenario.
Consistency Issues: In the rare event of a Redis failover, there could be a slight chance of inconsistency where multiple servers believe they are the first to process an item.
Scalability: While Redis is scalable, extremely high loads may still pose a challenge and require careful management and potential sharding.

Weaknesses of the Single Server Scenario
----------------------------------------------------
In the single server scenario, the solution uses a ConcurrentDictionary to prevent the same content from being processed more than once concurrently. While this approach addresses the issue within a single server environment, it has several limitations and weaknesses:

Scalability Limitations:

This solution operates on a single server and cannot scale horizontally. As traffic increases or the number of concurrent requests grows, the server's capacity might be overwhelmed, leading to performance degradation.
The server has limited resources, and managing all the load on a single server may not meet future growth and expansion needs.
Single Point of Failure:

If the single server fails or goes offline, the entire system goes down, causing a service outage. There is no backup or failover mechanism in place to ensure the system remains operational in the event of a server failure.
High Latency:

In a high-traffic scenario, managing concurrent requests and checking the ConcurrentDictionary can introduce latency. This increases the overall response time of the service, negatively impacting the user experience.
Handling a large number of requests simultaneously on a single server can lead to bottlenecks and delays.
Maintenance and Management Challenges:

All operations occur on a single server, making maintenance and management more challenging. The server requires regular updates, backups, and monitoring.
Operational tasks become more complex and risk-prone when they have to be performed on a single server.
Limited Resource Management:

A single server has limited CPU, memory, and storage resources. If these resources are exhausted, system performance can be severely affected.
Handling large volumes of data on a single server can be challenging, as the server might struggle to manage the load effectively.
